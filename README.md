# Particle Auth Core

## Quick start

You can scaffold a new Particle Auth Core app with one of the following commands, using your package manager of choice:

```bash
npm init @particle-network/auth-core-modal@latest
# or
pnpm create @particle-network/auth-core-modal@latest
# or
yarn create @particle-network/auth-core-modal
```

## Examples

Create a `.env` file like `.env.sample` in `./packages/auth-core-demo/` and replace `xxx` with your own Particle project configuration registered on the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).

To run an example locally, install dependencies.
